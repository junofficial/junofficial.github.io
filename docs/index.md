# Introduction

Welcome! My name is Junho Yang.

I am currently conducting research in the field of robotics, particularly focused on drone systems, robotic arms, and quadruped robots.

This research is based on simulation platforms such as **NVIDIA Isaac Lab** and **PyBullet**, which enable physics-based experiments and reinforcement learning integration.


Thank you for visiting this documentation!
